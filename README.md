### Project Title
Analyzing Bikeshare data of 3 US cities using R

### Description
**Project Overview:**
    In this project, I made use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The available data was analyzed to find:

      1. The median travel time for different type of users in Washington city
      2. The most common Start Station in Chicago city
      3. The counts of no. of trips for each gender in New York city

**Project Details:**

  ***Bike Share Data:***
    Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
    Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
    In this project, the data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, was used to uncover bike share usage patterns. The system usage between 3 large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington was compared:

  ***The Datasets:***
    Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.

    All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
      •	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
      •	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
      •	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
      •	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
      •	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
      •	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

    The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
      •	Gender
      •	Birth Year

  ***Analysis:***
  The available data was analyzed through 'R' programming language to find:

    1. The median travel time for different type of users in Washington city
    2. The most common Start Station in Chicago city
    3. The counts of no. of trips for each gender in New York city

  This analysis was also represented through plots such as Histogram and Box Plot.

  ***Result:***
  The results of the data analysis was then used to suggest some business decisions which can be taken such as:

    1. Different pricing for both 'Consumer' and 'Subscriber' user type.
    2. The most common station 'Streeter Dr & Grand Ave' is a great place for advertisement.
    3. There is a need to develop different strategy to target female commuters as the usage of Bikeshare by female commuters is very low.

### Files used
  The dataset files containing various data fields for the cities as given below:

    •	chicago.csv
    •	new_york_city.csv
    •	washington.csv
